# **huffman-zip**

It is a program which compresses and decompresses the size of text files based on huffman coding algorithm.

**Huffman coding** is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code.

This Project supports two functions:

- **Compress**:
  - Compresses passed input file and returns the compressed binary file
- **Decompress**:
  - Decompresses compressed input file and returns the original file
